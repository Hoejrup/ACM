# ACM_MonteCarlo_2019

## Installation

`devtools::install_github("aumath-advancedr2019/ACM_2019", build_vignettes = TRUE, dependencies = T)`


## The purpose of the package
The purpose of this package, is to provide useful functions for Monte Carlo simulations and general probabilty theory.

The plan is to make classes for a simulation result, and alter the defualt 'plot' and summary functions for these, in order to provide a quick way of evaluation your simulations.

Further we implement functions that by Monte Carlo computes the value of an integral, a function that runs an Acceptance-Rejection procedure.

Lastly we implement a class 'coplua' and provides a plot function for this, to see the dependence structure between to equal length vectors.
