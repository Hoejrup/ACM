# ACM_MonteCarlo_2019

## The purpose of the package
The purpose of this package, is to provide useful functions for Monte Carlo simulations and general probabilty theory.

The plan is to make classes for a simulation result, and alter the defualt 'plot' and summary functions for these, in order to provide a quick way of evaluation your simulations
